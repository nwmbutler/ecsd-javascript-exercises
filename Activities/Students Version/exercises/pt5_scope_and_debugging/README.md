# Scope & Debugging

## Exercise 1 - Scope

Take a look at `./exercise-1.js`, all variables have been defined as global. This isn't good, make changes to the declarations of the variables to fix the scope.

## Exercise 2 - Spawn Wave - Optional / Homework

Look at `./exercise-2.js` and open `exercise-2.html` in your browser. 

It should print a grid on a canvas within your browser view. Unfortunately, the code is a buggy mess! 

Using techniques for debugging we've been through, try and find the bugs and resolve them.

By the end, you should have a rendered grid which you can click to initiate a diamond shaped wave.
