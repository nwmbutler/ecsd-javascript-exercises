# Variables and Operators - Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Variable types

Look at `./exercise-1.js`, it asks what type is of the listed variables. There is a JS function which returns the type of a passed argument.

Once you've identified the function, cast it upon each of the variables in the exercise and output them to the console.

## Exercise 2 - Random

In `./exercise-2.js`, write code for the declaration of the variable `a` which sets it to a random integer from 1 to 1000 each time you run the script.

You may want to take a look at the **Math** library which comes with almost all JavaScript environments.

# Exercise 3 - References

Take a look at `./exercise-3.js`, take a minute to think over what the output might be for both the references. Once you've got an idea in your head, run the script and look at the output.

Was it what you were expecting? If not, why do you think you got this output?
